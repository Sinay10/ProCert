## üöÄ **Quick Working Demo** (Ready to Run!)

### **Current System Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Content Loaded**: AWS Advanced Networking Specialty (ANS) sample questions
- ‚úÖ **Authentication**: Fully functional user registration and login
- ‚úÖ **Vector Search**: 29 networking-related chunks indexed and searchable
- ‚úÖ **Rate Limiting Optimized**: Improved retry logic with 25s Lambda timeout
- ‚úÖ **All Demo Queries Working**: When spaced 30+ seconds apart

### **Working Demo Commands:**

#### **1. Test Quiz Generation Service**
**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Requires valid JWT token from authentication flow

```bash
# ‚úÖ WORKING: Generate adaptive quiz
curl -X POST "https://04l6uq5jl4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/quiz/generate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "your-user-id",
    "certification_type": "SAA",
    "question_count": 5,
    "difficulty": "mixed"
  }'
# Expected: Quiz session with adaptively selected questions

# ‚úÖ WORKING: Submit quiz answers
curl -X POST "https://04l6uq5jl4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/quiz/submit" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "quiz_id": "your-quiz-id",
    "answers": [
      {"question_id": "q1", "selected_answer": "Your answer"},
      {"question_id": "q2", "selected_answer": "Your answer"}
    ]
  }'
# Expected: Immediate scoring with detailed feedback

# ‚úÖ WORKING: Get quiz history
curl -X GET "https://04l6uq5jl4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/quiz/history/your-user-id" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
# Expected: List of completed quizzes with scores
```

#### **2. Test Content Queries (ANS Content Available)**
**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Space queries 30+ seconds apart to avoid Bedrock rate limiting

```bash
# ‚úÖ WORKING: Query about CloudFront and NLB (partial content available)
curl -X POST "https://04l6uq5jl4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/query" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "How do I configure CloudFront with Network Load Balancer?"}'
# Expected: Partial answer with offer for enhanced mode

# Wait 30 seconds, then:
# ‚úÖ WORKING: Query about Route 53 Resolver (comprehensive content available)
curl -X POST "https://04l6uq5jl4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/query" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is Route 53 Resolver?"}'
# Expected: Comprehensive answer about Route 53 Resolver from ANS materials

# Wait 30 seconds, then:
# ‚úÖ WORKING: Query without available content (shows fallback behavior)
curl -X POST "https://04l6uq5jl4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/query" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is AWS Lambda and how does it work?"}'
# Expected: "I don't have enough information... Would you like enhanced mode?"
```

#### **3. Test Authentication Flow**
```bash
# ‚úÖ WORKING: Step 1 - Register (use unique email each time)
curl -X POST "https://04l6uq5jl4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/auth/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "demo-unique-123@example.com", "password": "DemoPass123!", "name": "Demo User", "target_certifications": ["ANS", "SAA"]}'
# Expected: User registration success with user_id and profile

# ‚úÖ WORKING: Step 2 - Login
curl -X POST "https://04l6uq5jl4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "demo-unique-123@example.com", "password": "DemoPass123!"}'
# Expected: Login success with JWT tokens (access_token, id_token, refresh_token)

# ‚úÖ WORKING: Step 3 - Access Protected Profile (replace with your tokens)
curl -X GET "https://04l6uq5jl4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/profile/YOUR_USER_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
# Expected: User profile with study preferences and certifications
```

**Working Example (from our test):**
```bash
# Registration Response:
{"message": "User registered successfully", "user_id": "b4c87458-4041-70ff-2e05-9dd9b0619a82", ...}

# Login Response:
{"message": "Login successful", "tokens": {"access_token": "eyJraWQ...", ...}}

# Profile Response:
{"profile": {"email": "demo-test-123@example.com", "target_certifications": ["ANS", "SAA"], ...}}
```

    }
  }
}
```

#### 0.2 Submit Quiz Answers
```bash
# Submit answers and get immediate feedback
curl -X POST "https://04l6uq5jl4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/quiz/submit" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \

      "passed": true,
      "grade": "B",
      "time_taken": "15 minutes"
    }
  }
}
```

#### 0.3 Quiz History and Analytics
```bash
# Get user's quiz history
curl -X GET "https://04l6uq5jl4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/quiz/history/demo-user-123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"

# Get specific quiz details
curl -X GET "https://04l6uq5jl4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/quiz/your-quiz-id" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

#### 0.4 Adaptive Selection Demo
The quiz service demonstrates intelligent question selection:

**User Performance Analysis**:
- **Weak Areas (60% of questions)**: Categories where user scored <70%
- **Untested Areas (25% of questions)**: Categories user hasn't encountered
- **Strong Areas (15% of questions)**: Categories where user scored >80%
- **Anti-Repetition**: Avoids questions answered in last 7 days

**Example Adaptive Behavior**:
```
User Performance:
- Storage: 90% (Strong) 
- Compute: 45% (Weak)
- Database: 75% (Average)
- Networking: Untested

Quiz Selection (10 questions):
- 6 Compute questions (weak area focus)
- 3 Networking questions (untested area)
- 1 Storage question (reinforcement)
```

---

### **Scenario 1: Content Ingestion & RAG System**

#### 1.1 Upload Study Materials
```bash
# Upload a PDF to the SAA certification bucket
aws s3 cp your-saa-study-guide.pdf s3://procert-materials-saa-353207798766/

# Upload to DVA certification bucket
aws s3 cp your-dva-practice-exam.pdf s3://procert-materials-dva-353207798766/
```

**Expected Result**: 
- Lambda function automatically processes the PDF
- Content is chunked and embedded
- Vector data stored in OpenSearch
- Metadata saved to DynamoDB

#### 1.2 Query the RAG System
```bash
# Ask a general networking question (we have ANS content loaded)
curl -X POST "https://04l6uq5jl4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/query" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "How do I configure Amazon CloudFront with Network Load Balancer?"}'
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "answer": "Based on the AWS Advanced Networking Specialty materials, to configure Amazon CloudFront with a Network Load Balancer (NLB), you should create a CloudFront distribution with the NLB endpoint as the origin..."
}
```

#### 1.3 Certification-Specific Queries
```bash
# Ask ANS-specific question (we have ANS content loaded)
curl -X POST "https://04l6uq5jl4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/query" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "What are Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoint configurations?",
    "certification": "ANS"
  }'
```

**Expected Result**: Response focused on ANS-specific networking content and configurations.

#### 1.4 Content Without Context
```bash
# Ask about something not in our knowledge base
curl -X POST "https://04l6uq5jl4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/query" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is AWS Lambda and how does it work?"}'
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "answer": "I don't have enough information in the study materials to answer that question. Would you like me to use enhanced mode for broader AWS knowledge?"
}
```
