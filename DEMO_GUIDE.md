# üöÄ ProCert Learning Platform - Demo Guide

Welcome to the ProCert Learning Platform demo! This guide will walk you through the key features we've implemented for AWS certification learning.

## üìã What We've Built

### ‚úÖ **Task 1: Content Ingestion & RAG System**
- Multi-certification S3 buckets (SAA, DVA, SOA, CCP, etc.)
- Automated PDF processing and chunking
- Vector embeddings with Amazon Titan
- OpenSearch Serverless for semantic search
- Intelligent chatbot with RAG capabilities

### ‚úÖ **Task 2: User Authentication & Profile Management**
- AWS Cognito user authentication
- JWT-based API authorization
- User profile management
- Study preferences and certification tracking
- Secure API endpoints

---

## üöÄ **Quick Working Demo** (Ready to Run!)

### **Current System Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Content Loaded**: AWS Advanced Networking Specialty (ANS) sample questions
- ‚úÖ **Authentication**: Fully functional user registration and login
- ‚úÖ **Vector Search**: 29 networking-related chunks indexed and searchable
- ‚úÖ **Rate Limiting Optimized**: Improved retry logic with 25s Lambda timeout
- ‚úÖ **All Demo Queries Working**: When spaced 30+ seconds apart

### **Working Demo Commands:**

#### **1. Test Content Queries (ANS Content Available)**
**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Space queries 30+ seconds apart to avoid Bedrock rate limiting

```bash
# ‚úÖ WORKING: Query about CloudFront and NLB (partial content available)
curl -X POST "https://04l6uq5jl4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/query" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "How do I configure CloudFront with Network Load Balancer?"}'
# Expected: Partial answer with offer for enhanced mode

# Wait 30 seconds, then:
# ‚úÖ WORKING: Query about Route 53 Resolver (comprehensive content available)
curl -X POST "https://04l6uq5jl4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/query" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is Route 53 Resolver?"}'
# Expected: Comprehensive answer about Route 53 Resolver from ANS materials

# Wait 30 seconds, then:
# ‚úÖ WORKING: Query without available content (shows fallback behavior)
curl -X POST "https://04l6uq5jl4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/query" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is AWS Lambda and how does it work?"}'
# Expected: "I don't have enough information... Would you like enhanced mode?"
```

#### **2. Test Authentication Flow**
```bash
# ‚úÖ WORKING: Step 1 - Register (use unique email each time)
curl -X POST "https://04l6uq5jl4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/auth/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "demo-unique-123@example.com", "password": "DemoPass123!", "name": "Demo User", "target_certifications": ["ANS", "SAA"]}'
# Expected: User registration success with user_id and profile

# ‚úÖ WORKING: Step 2 - Login
curl -X POST "https://04l6uq5jl4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "demo-unique-123@example.com", "password": "DemoPass123!"}'
# Expected: Login success with JWT tokens (access_token, id_token, refresh_token)

# ‚úÖ WORKING: Step 3 - Access Protected Profile (replace with your tokens)
curl -X GET "https://04l6uq5jl4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/profile/YOUR_USER_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
# Expected: User profile with study preferences and certifications
```

**Working Example (from our test):**
```bash
# Registration Response:
{"message": "User registered successfully", "user_id": "b4c87458-4041-70ff-2e05-9dd9b0619a82", ...}

# Login Response:
{"message": "Login successful", "tokens": {"access_token": "eyJraWQ...", ...}}

# Profile Response:
{"profile": {"email": "demo-test-123@example.com", "target_certifications": ["ANS", "SAA"], ...}}
```

## üéØ Demo Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Content Ingestion & RAG System**

#### 1.1 Upload Study Materials
```bash
# Upload a PDF to the SAA certification bucket
aws s3 cp your-saa-study-guide.pdf s3://procert-materials-saa-353207798766/

# Upload to DVA certification bucket
aws s3 cp your-dva-practice-exam.pdf s3://procert-materials-dva-353207798766/
```

**Expected Result**: 
- Lambda function automatically processes the PDF
- Content is chunked and embedded
- Vector data stored in OpenSearch
- Metadata saved to DynamoDB

#### 1.2 Query the RAG System
```bash
# Ask a general networking question (we have ANS content loaded)
curl -X POST "https://04l6uq5jl4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/query" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "How do I configure Amazon CloudFront with Network Load Balancer?"}'
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "answer": "Based on the AWS Advanced Networking Specialty materials, to configure Amazon CloudFront with a Network Load Balancer (NLB), you should create a CloudFront distribution with the NLB endpoint as the origin..."
}
```

#### 1.3 Certification-Specific Queries
```bash
# Ask ANS-specific question (we have ANS content loaded)
curl -X POST "https://04l6uq5jl4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/query" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "What are Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoint configurations?",
    "certification": "ANS"
  }'
```

**Expected Result**: Response focused on ANS-specific networking content and configurations.

#### 1.4 Content Without Context
```bash
# Ask about something not in our knowledge base
curl -X POST "https://04l6uq5jl4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/query" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is AWS Lambda and how does it work?"}'
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "answer": "I don't have enough information in the study materials to answer that question. Would you like me to use enhanced mode for broader AWS knowledge?"
}
```

    "password": "DemoPass123!",
    "name": "Demo User",
    "target_certifications": ["ANS", "SAA"]
  }'
```

**Note**: Use a unique email for each registration attempt, or the system will return "User already exists".

**Expected Response**:
```json

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "YOUR_REGISTERED_EMAIL_HERE",
    "password": "DemoPass123!"
  }'
```

**Tip**: Replace `YOUR_REGISTERED_EMAIL_HERE` with the email you used in registration.

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -d '{
    "study_preferences": {
      "daily_goal_minutes": 60,
