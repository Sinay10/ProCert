## Study Time Estimates

The system uses realistic study time estimates based on certification complexity and industry data:

### Foundational Level
- **CCP (Cloud Practitioner)**: 20-40 hours
- **AIP (AI Practitioner)**: 20-40 hours

### Associate Level
- **SAA (Solutions Architect)**: 80-120 hours
- **DVA (Developer)**: 70-110 hours
- **SOA (SysOps Administrator)**: 70-110 hours
- **DEA (Data Engineer)**: 90-140 hours
- **MLA (ML Engineer)**: 90-140 hours

### Professional Level
- **SAP (Solutions Architect Pro)**: 120-200+ hours

## Environment Variables

- `USER_PROGRESS_TABLE_NAME`: DynamoDB table for user progress data
- `CONTENT_METADATA_TABLE_NAME`: DynamoDB table for content metadata
- `AWS_REGION`: AWS region (default: us-east-1)

## Dependencies

- `boto3`: AWS SDK for Python
- `botocore`: Low-level AWS service access
- `shared`: Custom shared modules for models and interfaces

## Error Handling

The Lambda function includes comprehensive error handling:

- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid input parameters or missing required fields
- **404 Not Found**: Invalid endpoint or resource not found
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Service errors or unexpected exceptions

All errors return a consistent JSON format:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Error description",
    "timestamp": "2025-01-08T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Testing

The function includes comprehensive unit and integration tests:

```bash
# Run unit tests
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_progress_tracker.py -v

# Run integration tests
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_progress_lambda.py -v

# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## Example Usage

See `examples/enhanced_progress_tracking_example.py` for a complete demonstration of all features and capabilities.

## Performance Considerations

- **Caching**: User session data cached in memory
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple interactions can be processed efficiently
- **Optimized Queries**: DynamoDB queries optimized for performance
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

## Security

- **Input Validation**: All inputs validated and sanitized
- **Authentication**: Integrates with existing JWT authentication
- **Data Privacy**: User data handled according to privacy requirements
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against abuse
