# GitLab Setup Guide for ProCert (Intern Project)

## Overview

This is a simplified GitLab setup guide tailored for intern projects using a single AWS account. This setup focuses on learning DevOps practices while keeping complexity manageable.

## Prerequisites

- Access to AWS internal GitLab (https://gitlab.aws.dev)
- Single AWS account with admin access
- Basic knowledge of Git and AWS
- AWS SSO/credentials for GitLab authentication

## Quick Start

### 1. Access Your Existing GitLab Repository

You already have a GitLab repository set up at:
**https://gitlab.aws.dev/ymarouaz/ProCert**

This is perfect for your intern project as it's:
- âœ… Already created and configured
- âœ… On AWS's internal GitLab instance
- âœ… Properly secured within AWS infrastructure

### 2. Repository Migration

The migration script is already configured for your AWS GitLab repository:

```bash
# The script is pre-configured for your repository
GITLAB_URL="https://gitlab.aws.dev"
GITLAB_PROJECT="ymarouaz/ProCert"
```

Run the migration:

```bash
./scripts/migrate_to_gitlab.sh
```

### 3. Configure CI/CD Variables

Go to your GitLab project â†’ Settings â†’ CI/CD â†’ Variables and add:

#### Required Variables

| Variable | Value | Settings |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Your AWS access key | âœ… Protected, âœ… Masked |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Your AWS secret key | âœ… Protected, âœ… Masked |
| `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` | Your AWS account ID (12 digits) | âœ… Protected |

**Security Note**: Use an IAM user with minimal required permissions, not your root account!

### 4. Create IAM User for GitLab

For security, create a dedicated IAM user for GitLab CI/CD:

```bash
# Create IAM user
aws iam create-user --user-name gitlab-ci-procert

# Create access key
aws iam create-access-key --user-name gitlab-ci-procert

# Attach necessary policies
aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name gitlab-ci-procert --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/PowerUserAccess
```

**Alternative**: Create a custom policy with only the permissions you need:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "cloudformation:*",
                "s3:*",
                "dynamodb:*",
                "lambda:*",
                "iam:*",
                "opensearch:*",
                "apigateway:*",
                "logs:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Simplified CI/CD Pipeline

The pipeline has been simplified for intern projects:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Validate] --> B[Test]
    B --> C[Security]
    C --> D[Build]
    D --> E[Deploy]
```

### Pipeline Stages

1. **Validate**: Code linting and CDK syntax validation
2. **Test**: Unit tests and integration tests
3. **Security**: Basic security scanning
4. **Build**: Package Lambda functions
5. **Deploy**: Deploy to your AWS account (manual trigger)

### Key Features

- **Single environment**: Everything deploys to your AWS account
- **Manual deployment**: You control when deployments happen
- **Security scanning**: Learn about security best practices
- **Test coverage**: See how well your code is tested

## Branch Strategy (Simplified)

For an intern project, use a simple branch strategy:

- **`main`**: Stable code that can be deployed
- **`feature/*`**: Feature development branches
- **`fix/*`**: Bug fix branches

### Workflow

1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/new-feature`
2. Make changes and commit
3. Push branch: `git push origin feature/new-feature`
4. Create merge request in GitLab
5. Review and merge to `main`
6. Deploy manually from `main` branch

## Learning Opportunities

This setup provides hands-on experience with:

### DevOps Practices
- âœ… Version control with Git
- âœ… CI/CD pipelines
- âœ… Infrastructure as Code (CDK)
- âœ… Automated testing
- âœ… Security scanning

### AWS Services
- âœ… CloudFormation (via CDK)
- âœ… Lambda functions
- âœ… DynamoDB
- âœ… S3
- âœ… OpenSearch
- âœ… API Gateway

### Software Engineering
- âœ… Code quality (linting, formatting)
- âœ… Unit testing
- âœ… Integration testing
- âœ… Code coverage
- âœ… Documentation

## Cost Management

Since this is an intern project on a personal AWS account:

### Free Tier Resources
- Lambda: 1M requests/month free
- DynamoDB: 25GB storage free
- S3: 5GB storage free
- API Gateway: 1M requests/month free

### Cost Monitoring
1. Set up AWS Budgets with alerts
2. Use AWS Cost Explorer to track spending
3. Clean up resources when not needed

### Resource Cleanup Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# cleanup.sh - Clean up AWS resources to save costs

echo "Cleaning up ProCert resources..."

# Destroy CDK stack
cdk destroy --all --force

echo "Cleanup completed!"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Pipeline Fails with AWS Credentials Error
**Solution**: 
- Verify CI/CD variables are set correctly
- Check IAM user has necessary permissions
- Ensure variables are marked as "Protected"

#### 2. CDK Bootstrap Fails
**Solution**:
```bash
# Bootstrap manually first
cdk bootstrap aws://YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/us-east-1
```

#### 3. Lambda Deployment Timeout
**Solution**: 
- Check Lambda function size
- Verify dependencies are correctly packaged
- Increase timeout in CDK stack

#### 4. DynamoDB Access Denied
**Solution**:
- Verify IAM permissions include DynamoDB
- Check table names match environment variables

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test CDK locally
cdk synth --all
cdk diff

# Test Lambda functions locally
cd lambda_src
python main.py

# Check AWS credentials
aws sts get-caller-identity

# View CloudFormation events
aws cloudformation describe-stack-events --stack-name ProcertInfrastructureStack
```

## Best Practices for Interns

### 1. Security
- âœ… Never commit AWS credentials to Git
- âœ… Use IAM users, not root account
- âœ… Enable MFA on your AWS account
- âœ… Regularly rotate access keys

### 2. Code Quality
- âœ… Write meaningful commit messages
- âœ… Add comments to complex code
- âœ… Write tests for new features
- âœ… Keep functions small and focused

### 3. Documentation
- âœ… Update README when adding features
- âœ… Document API endpoints
- âœ… Explain complex business logic
- âœ… Keep architecture diagrams current

### 4. Learning
- âœ… Read pipeline logs to understand what's happening
- âœ… Experiment with different AWS services
- âœ… Ask questions about unfamiliar concepts
- âœ… Document what you learn

## Next Steps

1. **Set up the repository** following this guide
2. **Run your first pipeline** and watch it work
3. **Make a small change** and see it deploy
4. **Explore GitLab features** like issues and merge requests
5. **Add monitoring** to see how your application performs
