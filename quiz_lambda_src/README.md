# Quiz Generation Service

The Quiz Generation Service is a core component of the ProCert Learning Platform that provides intelligent quiz generation, adaptive question selection, and comprehensive scoring with immediate feedback.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Adaptive Quiz Generation
- **Performance-Based Selection**: Questions are selected based on user's historical performance
- **Weak Area Focus**: Prioritizes topics where the user needs improvement (60% of questions)
- **Balanced Coverage**: Includes questions from untested areas (25%) and strong areas (15%)
- **Anti-Repetition Logic**: Avoids recently answered questions to prevent repetition

### ðŸ“Š Comprehensive Scoring
- **Immediate Feedback**: Provides instant results with explanations
- **Detailed Analytics**: Tracks performance by category and difficulty
- **Progress Tracking**: Records all interactions for future adaptive selection
- **Grade Calculation**: Converts scores to letter grades (A-F)

### ðŸ”„ Session Management
- **Persistent Sessions**: Quiz sessions are stored in DynamoDB
- **Status Tracking**: Monitors quiz progress (in_progress, completed, abandoned)
- **Time Limits**: Configurable time limits per quiz
- **History Tracking**: Maintains complete quiz history for each user

## Adaptive Selection Algorithm

The quiz service uses a sophisticated adaptive selection algorithm:

1. **Performance Analysis**: Analyzes user's historical performance by category
2. **Weak Area Identification**: Identifies categories with <70% average score or <70% accuracy
3. **Question Distribution**:
   - 60% from weak areas (prioritized for improvement)
   - 25% from untested areas (for comprehensive coverage)
   - 15% from strong areas (for reinforcement)
4. **Anti-Repetition**: Excludes questions answered in the last 7 days
5. **Difficulty Balancing**: Considers user's difficulty preferences

## Question Parsing

The service can parse questions from various text formats:

```text
Question: What is Amazon S3?
A) A storage service
B) A compute service
C) A database service
D) A networking service
Answer: A) A storage service
Explanation: Amazon S3 is a storage service for the cloud.
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `QUIZ_SESSIONS_TABLE` | DynamoDB table for quiz sessions | Yes |
| `USER_PROGRESS_TABLE` | DynamoDB table for user progress | Yes |
| `CONTENT_METADATA_TABLE` | DynamoDB table for content metadata | Yes |

## Database Schema

### Quiz Sessions Table
- **Partition Key**: `quiz_id` (String)
- **GSI**: `UserQuizIndex` - `user_id` (Hash), `started_at` (Range)

### User Progress Table
- **Partition Key**: `user_id` (String)
- **Sort Key**: `content_id_certification` (String, format: `content_id#certification_type`)
- **GSI**: `UserCertificationIndex` - `user_id` (Hash), `certification_type` (Range)

## Error Handling

The service provides comprehensive error handling:

- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid input parameters
- **404 Not Found**: Quiz session or user not found
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Service errors with detailed logging

## Performance Considerations

- **Caching**: User performance data is cached during quiz generation
- **Batch Operations**: Progress tracking uses batch writes for efficiency
- **Connection Pooling**: OpenSearch client uses connection pooling
- **Timeout Management**: Appropriate timeouts for all external calls

## Testing

The service includes comprehensive test coverage:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and logic
- **Integration Tests**: Test end-to-end workflows
- **Mock Services**: Use mocked AWS services for testing

Run tests:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_quiz_service.py -v
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_quiz_integration.py -v
```
