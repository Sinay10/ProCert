# Learning Platform Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ProCert Learning Platform is a comprehensive AWS certification study system that provides personalized learning experiences through an intelligent chatbot interface, dynamic quiz generation, and adaptive study recommendations. Building on the existing content management backend, this platform delivers interactive learning features that help users efficiently prepare for AWS certifications through AI-powered conversations, practice questions, and personalized study paths.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Interactive Chatbot Interface with Dual-Mode Response System

**User Story:** As a certification candidate, I want to interact with an AI chatbot that primarily uses curated study materials but can also access current online information when needed, so that I get accurate certification-focused answers with the option for broader, up-to-date context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a question to the chatbot THEN the system SHALL first attempt to retrieve relevant content from the vector database using semantic search (RAG-only mode)
2. WHEN the chatbot receives a query THEN it SHALL use AWS Bedrock to generate contextual responses based on the retrieved certification materials as the primary response method
3. WHEN a user specifies a certification type THEN the chatbot SHALL filter responses to content specific to that certification in both RAG and enhanced modes
4. WHEN the RAG-only mode provides sufficient relevant information THEN the chatbot SHALL respond using only the curated study materials with source citations
5. WHEN the RAG-only mode cannot find sufficient relevant information THEN the chatbot SHALL offer to use enhanced mode with Claude's built-in AWS knowledge
6. WHEN a user explicitly requests enhanced mode THEN the chatbot SHALL supplement RAG responses with Claude's comprehensive AWS knowledge for broader context
7. WHEN using enhanced mode THEN the chatbot SHALL clearly distinguish between curated study material content and Claude's general AWS knowledge
8. WHEN providing enhanced responses THEN the chatbot SHALL prioritize and highlight information from the curated materials while noting additional context from Claude's knowledge base
9. WHEN a user asks follow-up questions THEN the chatbot SHALL maintain conversation context and remember the preferred response mode (RAG-only or enhanced)
10. WHEN the chatbot provides any answer THEN it SHALL cite the source materials used, distinguishing between curated content and Claude's general knowledge
11. WHEN a user's question is ambiguous THEN the chatbot SHALL ask clarifying questions to provide more accurate responses in the appropriate mode
12. WHEN Claude's knowledge differs from curated materials THEN the chatbot SHALL note the difference and recommend prioritizing the curated certification-specific content

2. WHEN generating recommendations THEN the system SHALL identify weak areas based on quiz performance and question patterns
3. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL display personalized study recommendations on their dashboard
4. WHEN recommending content THEN the system SHALL prioritize topics with lower performance scores
5. WHEN a user has strong performance in an area THEN the system SHALL recommend advancing to more complex topics
6. WHEN generating recommendations THEN the system SHALL suggest specific study materials and practice questions
7. WHEN a user follows a recommendation THEN the system SHALL track engagement and adjust future recommendations accordingly

### Requirement 4: User Authentication and Authorization

**User Story:** As a certification candidate, I want to create an account and securely log in to the platform, so that my study progress and performance data are saved and personalized to my learning journey.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user visits the platform THEN they SHALL be able to create an account with email and password
2. WHEN a user creates an account THEN the system SHALL validate email format and password strength requirements
3. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate credentials and create a secure session
