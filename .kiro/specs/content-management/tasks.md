# Implementation Plan

## Project Status: Backend MVP Complete ✅

The ProCert Content Management System backend has been successfully implemented through Task 7, providing a fully functional content ingestion, processing, storage, and search system with certification-aware capabilities.

**Completed Tasks**: 1-7 (Core backend functionality)  
**Deferred Tasks**: 8-12 (Advanced features moved to `todo-later.md`)  
**Ready For**: Frontend development and integration

  - [x] 1. Enhance data models and core interfaces
    - Create Python dataclasses for ContentMetadata, QuestionAnswer, UserProgress, and VectorDocument models
    - Implement validation methods for each data model
    - Create type hints and interfaces for all service classes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 2. Add DynamoDB infrastructure and certification-aware S3 buckets
  - Update CDK stack to include DynamoDB tables for content metadata and user progress
  - Add separate S3 buckets or folder structure for different certifications and general content
  - Configure S3 object tagging for certification type metadata
  - Configure table schemas with certification_type as part of partition/sort keys
  - Add IAM permissions for Lambda functions to access DynamoDB and multiple S3 buckets
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 3. Enhance content processing with certification-aware extraction
  - Modify existing ingestion Lambda to detect certification type from S3 bucket/path/tags
  - Add logic to extract questions and answers from content with certification context
  - Implement automatic certification type detection from document headers/content
  - Add fallback to "general" classification for non-certification-specific content
  - Create unit tests for certification detection and content extraction functionality
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 4. Implement metadata storage service
  - Create StorageManager class with DynamoDB integration
  - Add methods to store and retrieve content metadata
  - Implement content versioning and relationship tracking
  - Write unit tests for metadata storage operations
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 5. Enhance vector storage with certification-specific metadata
  - Update existing OpenSearch storage to include certification_type field in all documents
  - Modify vector document format to include certification context for better RAG filtering
  - Add certification-specific search indices or index patterns
  - Update existing embedding storage logic to preserve certification metadata
  - Implement certification-aware chunking to avoid mixing content from different certs
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 6. Implement progress tracking service
  - Create ProgressTracker class with DynamoDB backend
  - Add methods to record user interactions and calculate progress
  - Implement progress analytics and completion tracking
  - Write unit tests for progress calculation logic
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 7. Enhance search service with certification-specific filtering
  - Extend existing search functionality to filter by certification_type first
  - Add certification-scoped search to prevent cross-certification content mixing
  - Implement fallback to "general" content when certification-specific results are insufficient
  - Add category-based and tag-based search within certification scope
  - Create unit tests for certification-aware search functionality
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

## Backend Implementation Complete

The core backend functionality has been successfully implemented through Task 7. The system now provides:

- ✅ Enhanced data models and core interfaces
- ✅ DynamoDB infrastructure and certification-aware S3 buckets  
- ✅ Enhanced content processing with certification-aware extraction
- ✅ Metadata storage service with DynamoDB integration
- ✅ Enhanced vector storage with certification-specific metadata
- ✅ Progress tracking service with comprehensive analytics
- ✅ Enhanced search service with certification-specific filtering

**Status**: Backend MVP Complete - Ready for Frontend Development

**Next Steps**: 
- Create frontend specification and implementation plan
- Advanced backend features (error handling, monitoring, optimization) have been moved to `todo-later.md` for future implementation

**Deferred Tasks**: Tasks 8-12 have been moved to `todo-later.md` and can be implemented in future iterations when advanced features are needed.
