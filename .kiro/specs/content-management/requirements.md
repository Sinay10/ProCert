# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables the certification platform to ingest, process, and store certification study materials in a structured format. The content management system will handle various types of study materials including questions, answers, and related content, making them searchable and accessible for users preparing for certifications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to ingest certification study materials, so that users have access to comprehensive study content for their certification preparation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN study materials are uploaded THEN the system SHALL process and validate the content format
2. WHEN content is ingested THEN the system SHALL extract questions and answers into structured data
3. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL store the content in the appropriate storage systems
4. IF content format is invalid THEN the system SHALL reject the upload and provide error details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want structured storage of questions and answers, so that content can be efficiently retrieved and managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN questions are processed THEN the system SHALL store them with proper categorization and metadata
2. WHEN answers are processed THEN the system SHALL associate them with their corresponding questions
3. WHEN content is stored THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity between questions and answers
4. WHEN content is updated THEN the system SHALL preserve version history and relationships

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As the system, I want to store content files in S3 with proper certification metadata, so that large study materials are stored cost-effectively and can be filtered by certification type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL store them in designated S3 buckets with certification-specific metadata
2. WHEN files are stored THEN the system SHALL extract or assign certification type metadata (e.g., "AWS-SAA", "AWS-DVA", "general")
3. WHEN files are processed THEN the system SHALL tag content chunks with certification context to improve RAG accuracy
4. WHEN files are accessed THEN the system SHALL provide secure, time-limited access URLs
5. IF storage fails THEN the system SHALL retry the operation and log failure details

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search for relevant study content, so that I can quickly find materials related to specific topics or concepts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users search for content THEN the system SHALL use OpenSearch for vector-based similarity search
2. WHEN content is indexed THEN the system SHALL create vector embeddings for semantic search capabilities
3. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL rank them by relevance and similarity
4. WHEN new content is added THEN the system SHALL automatically update the search index

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my study progress tracked, so that I can monitor my learning journey and identify areas needing improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with content THEN the system SHALL record their progress in DynamoDB
2. WHEN progress is tracked THEN the system SHALL store completion status, scores, and timestamps
3. WHEN users access their profile THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive progress analytics
4. WHEN progress data is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency and integrity
