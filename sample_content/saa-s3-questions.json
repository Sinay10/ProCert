      "question": "Which S3 storage class is most cost-effective for data that is accessed less than once per year?",
      "options": [
        "S3 Standard",
        "S3 Standard-IA",
        "S3 Glacier",
        "S3 Glacier Deep Archive"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 3,
      "explanation": "S3 Glacier Deep Archive is the most cost-effective storage class for data that is accessed less than once per year. It offers the lowest storage cost but has a retrieval time of 12 hours. It's designed for long-term backup and archive with very infrequent access.",

        "100 GB",
        "1 TB"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The maximum size of a single object in Amazon S3 is 5 TB (terabytes). However, the largest object that can be uploaded in a single PUT operation is 5 GB. For objects larger than 5 GB, you must use multipart upload.",

        "S3 Intelligent Tiering"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 3,
      "explanation": "S3 Intelligent Tiering automatically moves objects between two access tiers (frequent and infrequent access) based on changing access patterns. It monitors access patterns and moves objects that haven't been accessed for 30 consecutive days to the infrequent access tier.",

      "question": "What type of encryption does S3 use by default for new objects?",
      "options": [
        "No encryption",
        "SSE-S3 (Server-Side Encryption with S3-Managed Keys)",
        "SSE-KMS (Server-Side Encryption with KMS-Managed Keys)",
        "SSE-C (Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys)"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "As of January 2023, Amazon S3 applies server-side encryption with S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) as the base level of encryption for new objects stored in S3 buckets. This means all new objects are automatically encrypted at rest by default.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "S3 Lifecycle Rules can be configured to automatically delete incomplete multipart uploads after a specified number of days. This helps reduce storage costs by cleaning up incomplete uploads that may have been abandoned due to network issues or application failures.",
