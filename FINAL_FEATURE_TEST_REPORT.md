**DynamoDB Tables:**
- ‚úÖ content-metadata (Active)
- ‚úÖ user-progress (Active) 
- ‚úÖ recommendations (Active)
- ‚úÖ quiz-sessions (Active)

**OpenSearch:**
- ‚úÖ Cluster operational
- ‚úÖ Document ingestion working
- ‚úÖ Vector search functional
- ‚úÖ Content retrieval optimized

## ‚ö†Ô∏è READY BUT NEEDS DATA

### 4. Quiz Generation (90% Complete)
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **READY BUT NEEDS DATA**

**Features Implemented and Ready:**
- ‚úÖ Quiz generation logic implemented
- ‚úÖ Adaptive question selection algorithms
- ‚úÖ User performance analysis integration
- ‚úÖ Quiz session management
- ‚úÖ Scoring and feedback systems

**Missing Component:**
- ‚ùå Quiz questions not yet ingested into OpenSearch index

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "No questions found for certification type: SAA"
}
```

**Action Needed:** Ingest quiz questions into OpenSearch to enable full functionality

## üîß NEEDS ATTENTION

### 5. Progress Tracking (80% Complete)
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL FUNCTIONALITY**

**Issues Identified:**
- Endpoint routing needs refinement
- Some integration issues with shared modules
- Error: "Failed to record interaction"

**Note:** This was a recently enhanced feature and may need additional debugging

## üìä Overall Platform Statistics

| Feature Area | Status | Completion | Test Results |
