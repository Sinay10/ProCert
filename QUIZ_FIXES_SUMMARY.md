# Quiz Improvements & Fixes Summary

## 🐛 **Fixed: TypeError in QuestionFeedback Component**

**Problem**: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'charCodeAt')` when clicking any answer.

**Root Cause**: The `question.correct_answer` was undefined during the quiz (only available after submission), causing the `charCodeAt()` method to fail.

**Solution**: Modified `QuestionFeedback` component to handle missing `correct_answer`:
- Added null checks for `question.correct_answer` and `userAnswer`
- Shows "Answer Recorded" instead of "Correct/Incorrect" when correct answer is not available
- Gracefully handles the case where feedback can't be determined during the quiz
- Added informative message: "You'll see the correct answers and explanations at the end of the quiz"

## 🔄 **Fixed: Duplicate Questions Issue**

**Problem**: Same questions appearing multiple times in a single quiz session, even when there are 20+ questions available in the question bank.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive duplicate prevention:

### Frontend Changes:
- Added `unique_questions: true` parameter to quiz generation requests
- Added warning message display when insufficient unique questions are available
- Shows user-friendly error message: "Note: Only X unique questions available for this certification/difficulty"

### Backend Changes (`quiz_lambda_src/main.py`):
1. **New Parameter**: Added `unique_questions` parameter to quiz generation API
2. **Enhanced Question Selection**: Modified `select_adaptive_questions()` function:
   - Enforces strict uniqueness when `unique_questions=true`
   - Prevents duplicates within the same quiz session
   - Uses `content_id` to track question uniqueness
   - Falls back gracefully when insufficient unique questions exist

3. **Duplicate Prevention Logic**:
   - Filters out recently answered questions first
   - Removes duplicates within the selected questions by `content_id`
   - Adjusts question count if insufficient unique questions available
   - Maintains adaptive question selection while enforcing uniqueness

## 📋 **Files Modified**

### Frontend:
1. **`frontend/src/components/quiz/question-feedback.tsx`**
   - Fixed `charCodeAt` error with null checks
   - Enhanced UI to handle missing correct answers gracefully
   - Added informative messaging for users

2. **`frontend/src/components/quiz/quiz-interface.tsx`**
   - Added `unique_questions: true` to API requests
   - Added warning message display for insufficient unique questions
   - Enhanced error handling and user feedback

### Backend:
3. **`quiz_lambda_src/main.py`**
   - Added `unique_questions` parameter to `handle_generate_quiz()`
   - Updated `create_quiz_session()` function signature
   - Enhanced `select_adaptive_questions()` with duplicate prevention
   - Added comprehensive logging for debugging

## 🧪 **Testing**

Created test scripts to verify the fixes:
- **`test_quiz_improvements.py`**: Tests the original improvements
- **`test_unique_questions.py`**: Tests the new duplicate prevention feature

## 🎯 **User Experience Improvements**

### Before:
- Quiz would crash with TypeError when clicking any answer
- Same questions could appear multiple times in one quiz
- No feedback about question availability limitations

### After:
- ✅ No more crashes - smooth quiz experience
- ✅ No duplicate questions within a quiz session
- ✅ Clear warning when question bank is limited
- ✅ Graceful handling of missing correct answers during quiz
- ✅ Informative messaging keeps users informed

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### Error Prevention:
```typescript
// Before (caused crash)
const correctIndex = question.correct_answer.charCodeAt(0) - 65

// After (safe)
const hasCorrectAnswer = question.correct_answer && question.correct_answer.length > 0
if (!question.correct_answer || question.correct_answer.length === 0) return ''
const correctIndex = question.correct_answer.charCodeAt(0) - 65
```

### Duplicate Prevention:
```python
# Remove duplicates within selection
seen_ids = set()
unique_selected = []
for question in selected_questions:
    question_id = question.get("content_id", question.get("question_text", ""))
    if question_id not in seen_ids:
        seen_ids.add(question_id)
        unique_selected.append(question)
```

### API Enhancement:
```typescript
// Frontend request now includes
{
  certification_type: getCertificationCode(settings.certification),
  difficulty: settings.difficulty,
  count: settings.count,
  unique_questions: true  // NEW: Prevents duplicates
}
```

## 🚀 **Benefits**

1. **Reliability**: No more crashes when taking quizzes
2. **Quality**: No duplicate questions improve learning experience  
3. **Transparency**: Users know when question banks are limited
4. **Robustness**: Graceful handling of edge cases
5. **Maintainability**: Better error handling and logging

The quiz system is now much more robust and provides a better learning experience!
