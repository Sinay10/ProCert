# Quiz Improvements Summary

## üêõ Bug Fix: Answer Comparison Issue

**Problem**: Quiz answers were always marked as "wrong" because the system was comparing full option text (e.g., "A) Amazon Route 53") against the expected letter format ("A").

**Solution**: Modified `frontend/src/components/quiz/question-display.tsx` to store only the letter (A, B, C, D) when an answer is selected.

**Changes Made**:
- Updated the radio input `value` attribute to use `optionLetter` instead of `option`
- Updated the `isSelected` comparison to use `optionLetter`
- This ensures the stored answer format matches the expected backend format

## ‚ú® New Feature: Immediate Feedback After Each Question

**Enhancement**: Added immediate feedback after each question instead of waiting until the end of the quiz.

**Implementation**:
1. **New Component**: Created `frontend/src/components/quiz/question-feedback.tsx`
   - Shows immediate "Correct" or "Incorrect" feedback
   - Displays explanations for wrong answers
   - Provides context with the question text
   - Shows both user's answer and correct answer for wrong responses

2. **Updated Quiz Flow**: Modified `frontend/src/components/quiz/quiz-interface.tsx`
   - Added new `feedback` state to the quiz state machine
   - Updated flow: `settings ‚Üí active ‚Üí feedback ‚Üí active ‚Üí ... ‚Üí results`
   - Automatic transition to feedback state after answer selection
   - Continue button to proceed to next question or final results

3. **Enhanced Navigation**:
   - Removed "Next Question" button from active state (now handled by feedback)
   - Added helper text to guide users to select an answer
   - Maintained "Previous" button functionality with proper state management
