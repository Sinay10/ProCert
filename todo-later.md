# ProCert Backend - Future Enhancement Tasks

This document contains advanced backend tasks that were deferred from the initial implementation. These tasks can be implemented in future iterations when the project requires more advanced features.

## Deferred Backend Tasks (Tasks 8-12)

### Task 8: Add comprehensive error handling and validation
- Implement try-catch blocks with specific error types for all services
- Add input validation for all API endpoints and service methods
- Create custom exception classes for different error scenarios
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff for external service calls
- _Requirements: 1.4, 3.4, 4.4, 5.4_

**Priority**: Medium - Important for production readiness but not critical for MVP

### Task 9: Update API Gateway endpoints for new functionality
- Add new API endpoints for content metadata retrieval
- Create endpoints for progress tracking and analytics
- Add endpoints for category-based content browsing
- Update existing query endpoint to support filtering parameters
- _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.3_

**Priority**: High - Required for full frontend integration

### Task 10: Implement integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Create tests for complete content ingestion and processing workflow
- Add tests for search functionality across all storage systems
- Implement tests for progress tracking data consistency
- Create tests for API endpoint functionality with real AWS services
- _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

**Priority**: Medium - Important for reliability but can be added incrementally

### Task 11: Add monitoring and observability
- Implement CloudWatch custom metrics for content processing
- Add structured logging with correlation IDs across all Lambda functions
- Create CloudWatch alarms for error rates and performance thresholds
- Add X-Ray tracing for distributed request tracking
- _Requirements: 1.4, 3.4, 4.4, 5.4_

**Priority**: Low - Nice to have for production monitoring

### Task 12: Optimize performance and add caching
- Implement caching layer for frequently accessed metadata
- Add connection pooling for DynamoDB and OpenSearch clients
- Optimize Lambda memory allocation based on processing requirements
- Add batch processing capabilities for bulk content operations
- _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4.3, 4.4_

**Priority**: Low - Performance optimizations for scale

## Implementation Notes

### When to Implement These Tasks:

1. **Task 9** should be implemented when building the frontend, as it provides the necessary API endpoints
2. **Task 8** should be implemented before production deployment for reliability
3. **Tasks 10-12** can be implemented as the system scales and requires more robustness

### Dependencies:

- Task 9 is a prerequisite for advanced frontend features
- Task 8 enhances the reliability of all other tasks
- Tasks 10-12 are independent and can be implemented in any order

### Estimated Effort:

- Task 8: 2-3 days (comprehensive error handling)
- Task 9: 3-4 days (API Gateway endpoints and testing)
- Task 10: 4-5 days (comprehensive integration testing)
- Task 11: 2-3 days (monitoring and observability)
- Task 12: 3-4 days (performance optimization)

**Total estimated effort**: 14-19 days for all deferred tasks
