- **Root Cause**: Temporary API Gateway caching/deployment issue
- **Solution**: 
  - Verified JWT authorizer working correctly for all endpoints
  - Confirmed API Gateway configuration identical for profile and quiz endpoints
  - Issue resolved through deployment cycle and cache refresh
- **Result**: ‚úÖ All quiz endpoints now properly authenticated

#### 2. Question Extraction Enhancement
- **Problem**: AWS sample questions not being extracted due to format mismatch
- **Root Cause**: Regex patterns not matching AWS sample question format (`1) question... A) option B) option...`)
- **Solution**: 
  - Enhanced `extract_questions_and_answers()` function in ingestion Lambda
  - Added AWS-specific pattern: `(\d+)\)\s*(.+?)(?=\s*A\))\s*A\)\s*(.+?)...`
  - Improved question text cleaning and option parsing
  - Added fallback patterns for other question formats
- **Result**: ‚úÖ Successfully extracted 10 questions from ANS sample PDF

#### 3. OpenSearch Integration Fix

- **Root Cause**: Quiz service expected question data in OpenSearch metadata field, not text parsing
- **Solution**:
  - Modified quiz service to read from `metadata` field first
  - Enhanced question storage to include structured metadata
  - Updated `search_questions_by_certification()` to use metadata directly
  - Bypassed Bedrock throttling by storing questions without embeddings
- **Result**: ‚úÖ Quiz generation working with real ANS questions

- **Content Type Filtering**: Proper `content_type: "question"` filtering for quiz queries
- **Certification Filtering**: Questions properly tagged with certification type

#### Bedrock Throttling Workaround
- **Rate Limiting Awareness**: Identified Bedrock token limits causing failures
- **Alternative Approach**: Stored questions directly without embedding generation
- **Graceful Degradation**: System works without vector embeddings for quiz functionality
- **Future Enhancement**: Can add embeddings later when rate limits allow
